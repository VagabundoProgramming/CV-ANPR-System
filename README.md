# CV-ANPR-System.

This is a project from the class of Computer Vision at UAB University. 


### Objective

The main goal of this project is to create an algorithm capable of receiving <br>
an image of a car with its license plate visible and return the text of the  <br>
license plate. 

We focus on spanish license plates, that is why the code and images we have  <br>
only focus on that specific case.


### Structure

This repository is separated in to two folders, Code and Images.             <br>
                                                                             <br>
Within the image folder we have the a dataset that we used to evaluate the   <br>
model, the images are classified by angle. We also have some other useful    <br>
images such as individual characters for template matching.                  <br>
                                                                             <br>
Inside the Code folder we have all the code that we have used to create and  <br>
evaluate our model.                                                          <br>


### Methodology

The workflow we use for this project is the following:                       <br>

1. Finding Contours in the Image
2. Detecting License Plate
3. Applying Isomorphism
4. Template Matching CHaracters


### How to run

By downloading this repository you should be able to modify the code so that <br>
the file paths and executing the main.py file, yielding you results.         <br>
You can use the car images we provide in the repository.                     <br>
