## Objective

The main goal of this project is to create an algorithm capable of receiving <br>
an image of a car with its license plate visible and return the text of the  <br>
license plate. 

This project only tries to analyze spanish license plates.

## Structure

This repository is "objetivo" separated in to two folders, Code and Images.  <br>
Within the image folders we have thae dataset we have used to evaluate the model <br>
classified by angle alongside images for template matching.

In the Code folder we have all the code that we have used to create and evaluate <br>
the model.

If you want to use this code, download the code folder, and use the main to call the rest of the functions. 
You will also need to create a folder with images in your folder with the code.You can use the ones we provide here.


## Methodology

The workflow we use for the detection and retrieval of information is the following:
